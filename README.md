# Road-surfer van-rally routes checker

This is a simple checker for all rally routes offered by **Roadsurfer**.

# Why

Currently the company offers no way of filtering by return location, so I have found easier to just create this small script which outputs every route with available dates and find those interesting for me.

# How to use

Just clone the repo and run `python main.py`. The routes will appear on the terminal.

You can also store it to a file using `python main.py > routes.txt`

Once you know the route you want to pay for, just head to https://booking.roadsurfer.com/en/rally/ and book your van!

# Notes

Use this with responsibility, since it will hit Roadsurfer servers more than they would expect for a normal usage. As per my tests, available dates and routes don't change that often.

This *software* will be available until I get a mail from **Roadsurfer** to delete it.

There are also standard rates on https://roadsurfer.com ;)
